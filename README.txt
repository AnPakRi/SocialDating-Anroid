# WebView Android Dating App

### The Dating Android App for the French Dating Site coolonWeb
#### Meet new Cool People from anywhere thanks the Dating Android App available for your Smartphone


## Overview

This app is used for the [French Cool Dating Site](http://coolonweb.com). 

The design of coolonWeb is responsive that means we can easily create native apps without lot of code by only by using WebView.


## Want to do the Same?

You can also create a dating business for free with for example this **[Free Responsive Dating App Builder](http://ph7cms.com)**. 

You will be able then when your site is live to edit this app and change only `public final static String URL_SITE = "http://coolonweb.com";` by the URL of your site like `public final static String URL_SITE = "http://my-ph7cms-dating-app.com/?mobapp=1";`

Note that the `?mobapp=1` is important for [pH7CMS](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/_protected/framework/Mobile/MobApp.class.php#L20). This will help your site to be even better than normally on native app!

Finally, to change the name of your app, just edit `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and change the second line like the following: `<string name="app_name">My Awesome Social Dating App</string>`

Then don't forget to compile the project and build the APK file.
