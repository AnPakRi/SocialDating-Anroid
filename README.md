# Social Dating Android App

### *Create an Android Dating App easily*


## Overview

The app is basically a webview for pH7CMS Pro software that allows you to create your own social dating app with this android dating app builder.


## How It works

You will be able when your [pH7CMS Pro's website](http://ph7cms.com/pro) is live to edit this app and change only `public final static String URL_SITE = "http://demo.hizup.com/pH7CMS";` by the URL of your site like `public final static String URL_SITE = "http://my-ph7cms-dating-app.com/?mobapp=1";`

Note that the `?mobapp=1` is important for [pH7CMS](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/_protected/framework/Mobile/MobApp.class.php#L20). This will help your site to be even better than normally on native app!

Finally, to change the name of your app, just edit `/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and change the second line like the following: `<string name="app_name">My Awesome Social Dating App</string>`

Then don't forget to change the package name by refactoring the app and compile the project and build the APK file.
